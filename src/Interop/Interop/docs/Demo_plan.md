### Holistic integration platform

  o Basic message transfer
  	o Web -> Akka.Net -> RabbitMq -> Kafka
  o Show message status & movement
  o Share available schemas (input & output)
  o Show current status
  	o Nodes & messages
  o Demo
  	o From website into files, KAFKA, other messages, etc... and back again via sockets?



### Tjenestekatalog

   o List services
   o Show service information
   o Service SLA information
   o Retrieve SLA information programmatically
   o List aviailable schemas...
   o Service discovery [lighthouse? via akka.net cluster?]




### Where to start...


1) Want to show an integration scenario
  Between two parties with our services interjected?

2) Want to show schema controll
  Basic
  Evolving
  Documentation [available in simplified format from FINT]
  Consumption of FINTs models
  Publishing

3) Want to show uptake of the CMDB information
  This makes a great ATL use case: transfer from virtual desktop to main computer to kafka to BizTalk

4) BizTalk integration
  Show how porjects can show up there
  Show how endpoints can be mapped
  Dynamic endpoints -> BizTalk (via F-ShizTalk)
    two-way mapping?  
    Use the object model from that documentation to create/map them?
    Declarative TJA model showing how they should be constructed on both sides?


5) A little intro to Docker & Docker files
  Example: https://github.com/komljen/dockerfile-examples/blob/master/apache/Dockerfile
